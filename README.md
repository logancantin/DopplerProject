# The Doppler Effect: An In-Depth Explanation and Analysis
This is an independant project for my Physics Class. The goal of this project is to:
- Give a fundamental understanding of the Doppler effect;
- Build a more complex formula to accurately model the sound of a passing car;
- Learn about the properties of complex waves and the Fourier Transform;
- Verify our hypothesis using Octave/Matlab;
- Explore the practical implications of the Doppler effect as it applies to flight near supersonic speeds; And
- Make deep connections to other physical phenomena.

## Purpose
At its core, the purpose of this project is to assuage the curiosity I had about the Doppler effect. The brief explanation that we received in class was not enough to satiate my curiosity and I set out on a journey of discovery. This is one of the most comprehensive projects that I have undertaken and along the way I have learned a lot about the Doppler effect, the Fourier Transform, Octave/Matlab, LaTeX, and Adobe Illustrator. My hope is that, by publishing my research and resources, my peers and anyone else can also learn about the Doppler effect, related physics phenomena, and the Fourier Transform.

## Lab Report
All of the information gathered through this project has been compiled into a lab report. I chose to do this to organize my information in a structured and easy to read document. The main Lab Report will allow you to replicate this experiment at home if you want. Regardless, the information it contains will give you a thorough understanding of the Doppler effect and why a passing car sounds the way it does. In addition, the Analysis section takes the new tools that we derived for the car and extrapolate to make connections to supersonic travel, sonic booms, and more. Additional information and sources are available to continue your research in the Appendices.

## Files
The sound files which I recorded and used for my analysis are available for your use, should you wish to try the analysis yourself but you don't have the means to actuall carry out the experiment. In addition, all of the full resolution graps of my results are available, as well as amalgamated versions. *Note: The naming scheme works as follows: xx-yyy.(png|wav), where xx represents the speed of the vehicle in km/h and yyy represents the frequency, in Hz.*

## Tools
I have also included the scripts for you to be able to run the analysis scripts yourself. Please note that this is not for beginners, and I recommend that you only attempt this if you are an experienced programmer and are familiar with Octave/Matlab. Instructions for running the script are located in [frequencyAnalyzer.m](scripts/frequencyAnalyzer.m). **Note: the script is not very user-friendly right now. Please be patient as I adapt it for public use.**

## Additional Resources
I will post a list of the resources that I used in the coming days. Stay tuned!
